    "First, attack graphs are only generated when a path exists to the goal.\n",

    "This means that any attack graph based metric only measures how insecure a system already is. We've already lost if we're at this stage.\n",

    "Our job is to verify that the presumption of security is not only naive from a monotonic permissions perspective, but also from a reduced subset of standard network model.\n"
